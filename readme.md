This project is a composition (pun intended) of patterns, 
algorithms and data structures implementations on Java. The global idea
is to create all-in-one-place project with easy navigation and easy
comprehensible descriptions for anyone to use.
 
It might turn into some composition (pun intended once again) of N projects 
in future if this ones structure get too hard.

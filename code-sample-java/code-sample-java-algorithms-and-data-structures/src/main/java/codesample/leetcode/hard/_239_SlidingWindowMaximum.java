 * 239. Sliding Window Maximum â€” https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/
 * <p>
 * You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
 * <p>
 * Return the max sliding window.

 * NOTE: NOT COMPLETE SOLUTION

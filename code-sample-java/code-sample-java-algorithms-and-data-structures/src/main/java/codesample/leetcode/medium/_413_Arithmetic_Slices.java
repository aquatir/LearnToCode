/**
 * 413. Arithmetic Slices â€” https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices/
 *
 * An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two
 * consecutive elements is the same.
 *
 * For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences.
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums.
 * A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

            // - some number of subarrays which are already complete and are arithemtic
            // - some number of subarrays which are not yet arithemtic but could be (e.g. 1/2 elements)
            // - some number of subarrays which are arithemic but could also be increased in size
            // to create new arithmetic subarrays

/**
 * 142. Linked List Cycle II â€” https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/
 * <p>
 * Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following
 * the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 * Do not modify the linked list.

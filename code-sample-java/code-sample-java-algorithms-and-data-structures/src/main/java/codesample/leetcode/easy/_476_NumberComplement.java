/**
 * 476. Number Complement â€” https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/
 * <p>
 * The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.
 * <p>
 * For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
 * Given an integer num, return its complement.

/**
 * 202. Happy Number â€” https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/
 *
 * Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
 *
 * A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
 *
 * Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
 * Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
 * Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
 * Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

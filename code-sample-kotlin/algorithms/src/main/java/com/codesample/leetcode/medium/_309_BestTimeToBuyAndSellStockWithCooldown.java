/**
 * 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown â€” https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/
 * <p>
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
 * Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell
 * <p>
 * one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:
 * After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

/**
 * 63. Unique Paths II â€” https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/
 *
 * A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
 *
 * The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
 *
 * Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
 *
 * An obstacle and space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

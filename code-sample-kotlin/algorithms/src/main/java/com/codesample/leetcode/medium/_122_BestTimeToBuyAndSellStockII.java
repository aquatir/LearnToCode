 * 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II â€” https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/
 *
 * You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
 * On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time.
 * However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
 * Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
